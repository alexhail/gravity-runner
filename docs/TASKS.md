# Implementation Tasks

*** REMEMBER: ALWAYS UPDATE YOUR MOST RECENT CURRENT FOCUSES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE ***

>>> Official Prompt: 
Using @docs as a guide, implement the next uncompleted task for our @frontend or @backend in the @TASKS.md file and check them off when you are done.

>>> Follow up prompt: 
Yes please implement the next task for the @frontend or @backend in the @TASKS.md file and check them off when you are done.

>>> Current Fixes Prompt:
Using @docs as a guide, implement the current fixes for our @frontend or @backend in the @TASKS.md file.

>>> Tasks.md Optimization Prompt:
Using @docs as a guide, as well as the @frontend and @backend folders of our project, and optimize the @TASKS.md file and replace the tasks that are no longer needed with a summary of them under a "Completed" header. Then analyze the remaining tasks and determine if they are still relevant or if they can be removed, and provide some possible future phases, improvements, features, or ideas for the project.
